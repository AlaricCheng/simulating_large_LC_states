- `LCC_Generator.nb` is a Mathematics notebook, and is used to generate the terms in the expansion of `ODD` and `EVEN` in Eq. (4) of the main text. The results are stored in `./cache/mask_cache`.

- `big_circuit3_check_temp_likelyrho_1.txt` contains the probability distributions obtained from sub-circuit 1. There are 25 groups of distributions due to 25 repetitions of the experiment. In each group, there are 36 probability distributions, corresponding to different initial states and measurement bases. 

- `big_circuit3_check_temp_likelyrho_2.txt` contains the probability distributions obtained from sub-circuit 2. There are 25 groups of distributions due to 25 repetitions of the experiment. In each group, there are 12 probability distributions, corresponding to different initial states and measurement bases. 

- `cluster12_likelyrho.csv` is the probability distributions from 12-qubit linear cluster states, after processing with the maximum likelihood method.
